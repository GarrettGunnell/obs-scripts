# Acerola's OBS Scripts

These are scripts I have made to assist my stream, feel free to use them yourself!

If you do use them, I'd love it if you would credit me so that others can easily find the same tool.

If you have issues please contact me here: https://twitter.com/Acerola_t or [Discord](https://discord.gg/FxGQvbfm6Y)

## Scripts

* [**PNGTuber State Machine**](https://github.com/GarrettGunnell/obs-scripts/tree/main/pngtuber) *(Windows Only)*
* * Animate your PNGTuber by swapping between sprites based on your mic volume.

# How To Use

### Install Python

OBS does not natively come with a Python installation, so you have to do that!

Please go [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-31010/) and scroll to the bottom and download the `Windows installer (64-bit)`.

Take note of the location you install Python to. For me, this location is `C:\Python310\`.

### OBS Python Settings

Open OBS and in the top bar click `Tools` -> `Scripts`.

This will open a window with two tabs. Navigate to `Python Settings` and enter the path to your Python installation that you took note of earlier.

It should look like this:

### Activate Script

Then in the same window navigate to `Scripts`.

To use one of my scripts you have to download it, so make sure you have the script file in an easy to access location. In the bottom left of the `Scripts` window there is a large + sign. Click the plus sign and navigate to the script file and confirm.

This will load the script into OBS and you're all finished!
